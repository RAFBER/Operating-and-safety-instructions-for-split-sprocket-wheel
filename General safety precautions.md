### This chapter tells you:
{: .no_toc}
* The duties of the owner
* The safety equipment
* The requirements of the personnel
* The recommended protective equipment

## Duties of the user/owner
Ensure that:  
* The dangerous areas around the rotating parts at the input and output sides are secured with solid guard covers to prevent accidental contact.  
* The personnel wear personal protective equipment in accordance with chapter "Personal protective equipment".  
* The power supply is switched off before work on the gearbox is begun.  
* The gearbox is only operated within the permissible limits.  
* The gearbox is only operated when in proper working order.  
* The gearbox is only operated with properly functioning safety equipment (see Chapter "Safety equipment").  
* Defects that you can eliminate yourself are taken care of immediately.  
* Defects that you cannot eliminate yourself are taken care of by an FLSmidth MAAG Gear Sp. z o.o. service engineer as soon as possible.  
* Only spare parts supplied by MAAG Gear Sp. z o.o. are used for repairs.  
Some spare parts are specially manufactured in accordance with FLSmidth MAAG Gear Sp. z o.o. specifications. Only spare parts supplied by FLSmidth MAAG Gear Sp. z o.o. correspond to these specifications.  
* Repair and maintenance work is only carried out by trained professionals.  
* No unauthorized modifications are made to the gearbox.  
* Product-specific safety data sheets from the product manufacturers are ob-served when using lubricants and cleaning agents.  

## Safety equipment
The following items of safety equipment are required for safe operation of the gearbox:  
* Emergency stop buttons  
* Guard covers around rotating parts  
* Gearbox monitoring (Programmable logic controller)  

### Emergency stop buttons
As an incomplete machine, the gearbox does not have its own Emergency stop buttons.  

=> Integrate the gearbox into the Emergency stop concept of the overruling machine.  
=> Integrate the gearbox so that the power to at least the following components is interrupted when pressing an emergency stop button.
- Drive motor, auxiliary drive motor (If installed)
- Pump motors
- Heaters (If installed)  

=> Regard the control and monitoring description and/or the Interlocking and Monitoring Table.

### Guard covers
As an incomplete machine, the gearbox is not equipped with guard covers to prevent contact with the rotating parts of the input and output sides.  

=> Install solid guard covers to prevent injuries with rotating parts.  

### Gearbox monitoring
As an incomplete machine, the gearbox does not have its own programmable logic controller (PLC) for monitoring and operation.  

=> Integrate the gearbox and its instruments into the main controller (PLC) of the cement factory or into the intermediate programmable logic controller (PLC) of the mill, to protect the gearbox from impermissible operating conditions and im-proper operation. 

The gearbox is provided with the following instruments for monitoring:  
* Resistance thermometer for measuring the tilt-pad temperature
* Resistance thermometer for measuring the oil outlet temperature
* Resistance thermometers for measuring the bearing temperatures at the bevel gear stage  
* Vibration sensors for measuring vibrations of the housing
* Flow meter for measuring the oil flow at the gearbox inlet (optional)

Other instruments for monitoring the gearbox can be found:
* At the oil supply unit
* At the suction pump (optional component)
* At the auxiliary drive (optional component)  

Since the gearbox monitoring is also dependent on other components, the functions of the instruments and the requirements of the programmable logic controller (PLC) are described in depth in the control and monitoring description and/or the Interlock-ing and Monitoring Table.

### Requirements of the personnel
Ensure that:
* These instructions have been read and understood by the responsible persons before installation, commissioning, operation or maintenance is carried out.
* The personnel wear personal protective equipment in accordance with chapter "Personal protective equipment".
* The gearbox is only installed under the supervision of appropriately trained technical personnel from the gearbox or the machine manufacturer.
* The gearbox is only lifted with a crane or transported by appropriately trained technical personnel.
* Work on electrical installations is only carried out by professional electricians.

### Organizational measures
* Retain the instructions until the gearbox is disposed of.
* Keep the instructions in a location near the gearbox where they can be accessed at all times.
* If you sell or pass on the gearbox to another party, be sure to pass on these instructions along with the gearbox.
* If you do not understand something in these instructions, contact our customer service department. We shall be pleased to help you.
* If you find errors in these instructions, please contact our customer service department.

## Personal protective equipment
FLSmidth MAAG Gear Sp. z o.o. recommends that you wear the following personal protective equipment:
